**Piling Sheet Image Data 2022** is a dataset for object detection and classification tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the construction industry. 

The dataset consists of 2914 images with 2430 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *dim* and *ref*.

Images in the Piling Sheet Image Data dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 2563 (88% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *classification* (2463 images), *object detection train* (245 images), *object detection val* (106 images), and *test* (100 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 4 classification set classes: ***4-rock*** (632 images), ***4-metal_bad*** (619 images), ***4-metal_good*** (608 images), and ***4-grass*** (593 images), or into 6 classification set classes (alternative): ***6-rock*** (344 images), ***6-grass*** (330 images), ***6-metal_good*** (326 images), ***6-metal_moderate*** (311 images), ***6-metal_acceptable*** (284 images), and ***6-metal_bad*** (156 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Delft University of Technology, Netherlands</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Witteveen+Bos, Netherlands</span>.
