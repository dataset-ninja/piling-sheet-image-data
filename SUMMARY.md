**Piling Sheet Image Data 2022** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the construction industry. 

The dataset consists of 451 images with 2430 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *Dim* and *Ref*.

Images in the Piling Sheet Image Data dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 100 (22% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (100 images), *train* (245 images), and *val* (106 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the Delft University of Technology, Netherlands.
