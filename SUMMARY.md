**Piling Sheet Image Data 2022** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the construction industry. 

The dataset consists of 2914 images with 2430 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *Dim* and *Ref*.

Images in the Piling Sheet Image Data dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 2563 (88% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *test* (100 images), *classification* (2463 images), *object detection train* (245 images), and *object detection val* (106 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the Delft University of Technology, Netherlands and Witteveen+Bos, Netherlands.
