This is a piling sheet data used for classification and object detection. The classes are based on [Digiggids](https://digigids.hetwaterschapshuis.nl/index.php?p=gallery). Two classificiation algorithm have been made:

1. Classification with four classes: Grass, Metal good, Metal bad and Rock.
2. Classification with six classes: Grass, Metal good, Metal acceptable, Metal moderate and Metal bad and Rock.

Object detection was used to detect dimensional features and estimate dimensions that could tell us about the type of piling sheet
